# Readme.io Markdown Transformer

Simple React application that converts [readme.io](https://readme.com/) flavored markdown into HTML and renders it to the screen.

### Usage

Clone the repository, add your `.md` files into `/public/markdown` folder and update the `markdownFile` const in `index.js`.

Run the application locally with `npm run dev`, the index page will now display the markdown.


### Notes from the author

This is not intended to be a full application, it was just something I put together quickly to solve a problem I had at the time.
